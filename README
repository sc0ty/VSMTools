1. About VSM files
VSM files are BlackBerry branding files. Every VSM file contain resources like startup
image, specified value of time to show this image, default ringtone, internet
configuration etc. Resources are identified by id numbers. Every ID has its own specified
function, e.g. resource id 0x00 is startup image and id 0x1003 is welcome message subject.
Using VSMTools you can extract resources from VSM file (every resources will be extracted
to separate file) or create your own VSM using your own resource files. You can obtain
more information about resource ids reading resources.txt file or visit urls:

http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/4.1api/net/rim/device/api/system/Branding.html
VSM file contains also Vendor ID (IDs and coresponding names are listed in vendors.txt),
and can contain footer with digital sign. This software is unable to sign VSM files.
You can load VSM files into BlackBerry using MML software.

2. VSMTools commands

2.1. VSM file extraction
To extract VSM file use:
vsmtools -e VSM_FILE.VSM [OUTPUT_DIR]
    VSM_FILE.VSM    - path to input VSM file
    [OUTPUT_DIR]    - output directory (optional)

Resources will be extracted to specified directory, every resource will be named like
resXXXX_DESCRIPTION.bin, where XXXX is resource ID. There will be also created header.bin
(it is VSM header) and footer.bin (if VSM contains any footer).

Egzamples:
	vsmtools -e file.vsm
	vsmtools -e file.vsm "output directory"

2.2. VSM file creation
To create VSM file use:
vsmtools -c [options] INPUT_DIR [VSN_FILE.VSM]
	INPUT_DIR	    - path to resources directory
	[VSM_FILE.VSM]	- output VSM file (optional)
optional options:
    -vid x      - set Vendor ID to x (decimal value)
    -dh         - generate default header (don't load header.bin)
    -df         - don't include footer section from footer.bin
    -v x.x.x.x  - set verson file number

Resources in INPUT_DIR must be named like resXXXXwhatever, where XXXX is resource ID
(for egzample "res0002_FIELD_BITMAP_2_DATA.png" or "res1002"). Every resource file
should be not larger than 65535 byte, otherwise it will be truncated. There should
be also 28-bytes header file (header.bin), or you can generate your own header using -dh.
If there is footer.bin it will be inserted at the end of the file (you can prevent it
using -df switch). You can set your own version number using -v switch - for egzample
-v 1.0.0.123.
File names in resources directory are compatibile between extract and create command.

Egzamples:
	vsmtools -c MY_VSM_DIR
	vsmtools -c -vid 123 -df MY_VSM_DIR my.vsm
	vsmtools -c -v 1.10.2.100 MY_VSM_DIR

2.3. Gathering VSM file information
To show VSM file information use:
vsmtools -i VSN_FILE.VSM
    VSM_FILE.VSM    - path to input VSM file

This command show you file information, list of resources and other file parameters.

Egzamples:
	vsmtools -i file.vsm

2.4. Modify VSM file
To modify VSM file use:
vsmtools -m [options] VSM_FILE.VSM
	VSM_FILE.VSM	- input VSM file
optional options:
    -h file.bin - load header form file (header.bin or other VSM file)
    -vid x      - set Vendor ID to x (decimal value)
    -cs         - calculate and write correct resources checksum
    -v x.x.x.x  - set verson file (format: 1.0.0.123)
    -db         - don't backup modified file

Before modification there will be backup file created (with bak extension). If you don't
want that, use -db switch.
Modufy function rewrite only header data, there is no need to recalculate checksum.
